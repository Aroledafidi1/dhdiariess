    <h1>🇳🇬 ₦200 Billion Youth Development Fund Launched</h1>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 18, 2025</p>

    <p>
      In a bold policy move aimed at tackling unemployment and supporting innovation, President <strong>Bola Ahmed Tinubu</strong> has unveiled a <strong>₦200 billion Youth Development Fund</strong> targeting young Nigerians in the creative, tech, and agricultural sectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fund, which will be managed through the Ministry of Youth Development and the Bank of Industry (BOI), is designed to offer <strong>grants and low-interest loans</strong> to startup founders, digital creators, music entrepreneurs, agropreneurs, and other youth-led ventures.
    </p>

    <h2>🚀 Who Can Benefit?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Young Nigerians aged 18–35 with viable business ideas</li>
      <li>Registered startups and informal entrepreneurs</li>
      <li>Music and film producers, fashion designers, app developers</li>
      <li>Youth cooperatives in agriculture and renewable energy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The initiative is part of the administration's wider “<strong>Renewed Hope Youth Agenda</strong>” and follows increasing calls from youth groups and activists for practical economic reforms.
    </p>

    <h2>🗣️ Public Reactions</h2>
    <p>
      Youth leaders and advocacy groups have praised the move, urging the government to ensure transparency and regional balance. Critics, however, warned about potential corruption and political favoritism.

    <blockquote>
      “This is the kind of investment that can ignite real change, if done right,” said Omoyele Dada, founder of the Nigerian Innovation Network.
