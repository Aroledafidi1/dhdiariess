    <h1>📚 5 Study Hacks for Success</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 28, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Subtitle:</strong> Simple tricks students can use to boost grades easily.</p>

    <h2>1. Use the Pomodoro Technique ⏱️</h2>
    <p>
      Study in focused 25-minute sessions with 5-minute breaks in between. After 4 sessions, take a longer break (15–30 minutes). This helps improve concentration and reduces burnout.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Teach What You Learn 👩🏾‍🏫</h2>
    <p>
      Explaining what you've studied to someone else forces you to understand the material better. If you can teach it, you truly know it!
    </p>

    <h2>3. Study Before Bed 🛏️</h2>
    <p>
      Reviewing notes before sleeping helps your brain retain information better during rest. Just don’t cram—review calmly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Create Visual Summaries 🧠</h2>
    <p>
      Turn your notes into mind maps, diagrams, or flashcards. Visual learning helps your brain process complex information faster and more effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Use Active Recall, Not Just Reading 🔁</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of just re-reading, quiz yourself regularly. Close your book and try to recall what you just studied. It's one of the most powerful ways to strengthen memory.
    </p>

    <h2>Bonus Tip 🎯</h2>
    <p>
      Avoid multitasking. Focus on one subject at a time in a distraction-free environment. Music is fine, but turn off notifications!
