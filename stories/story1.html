    <h1>🌅 The Bread Seller’s Son – A Story of Hope from Ajegunle</h1>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 28, 2025</p>

    <p>
      In the heart of <strong>Ajegunle, Lagos</strong>, where the streets are alive with the scent of grilled suya and the hum of danfo buses, 14-year-old <strong>Michael Ojo</strong> starts his morning selling bread before school.
    </p>

    <p>
      His mother, Mama Ojo, is a familiar face in the area — balancing a tray of agege bread on her head with grace and strength. Despite life’s hardship, she has kept her son in school with nothing but determination and faith.
    </p>

    <p>
      "We don't have much, but we believe in hard work," she says. Michael agrees — he’s already topping his class in Mathematics at Ajegunle Community High School and dreams of becoming an engineer.
    </p>

    <h2>💡 A Spark of Hope</h2>
    <p>
      Last month, a short video of Michael studying under a streetlight went viral on social media. Touched by his story, a local NGO awarded him a full scholarship through university, and a tech startup donated a laptop and solar-powered reading lamp.

    <p>
      “I didn’t expect this,” Michael said shyly. “I just want to make my mummy proud.”
    </p>

    <h2>🌍 Bigger Than One Family</h2>
    <p>
      Michael’s story isn’t just his — it reflects the everyday resilience of many Nigerian families. DHDiaries celebrates the stories of regular people who show us that greatness often begins in quiet places.
