    <h1>🚌 Last Bus Stop – A Love Story That Started on a Danfo</h1>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 28, 2025</p>

    <p>
      The day I met her, it was raining — that stubborn Lagos kind of rain that soaks you even if you’re standing under a roof. I jumped into a half-filled <strong>danfo heading to CMS</strong>, and there she was. In a yellow dress, drenched and laughing at the chaos. I offered her my spare handkerchief. She smiled. I almost forgot to pay my fare.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her name was <strong>Amarachi</strong>. She was a writer, always reading, always scribbling in her red notepad. We started talking every day on that same route. I began looking forward to traffic just to spend more time with her.
    </p>

    <p>
      For months, we talked — dreams, heartbreaks, jollof vs fried rice debates. But we never exchanged numbers. “Let’s keep this danfo thing pure,” she’d say. I thought it was cute. Then one day… she didn’t show up.
    </p>

    <h2>🔍 Searching for Her</h2>
    <p>
      I waited. The next day, and the day after. One week. Two. The conductor began to notice. “Oga, she no dey come again,” he said, shaking his head like he too had lost something. I even asked around CMS. Nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just when I was about to give up, I saw her again. Not in a danfo. But on a billboard. She had published a book. The title? <strong>“Last Bus Stop”</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>📖 The Ending I Didn’t Expect</h2>
    <p>
      I bought the book that same day. Inside the dedication page, it read:
      <em>"To the guy with the white handkerchief, who reminded me that real stories still happen on real streets."</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      I never saw Amarachi again. But every time I enter a danfo, I carry a copy of her book. And I leave a handkerchief on the seat.
