    <h1>🛡️ Nigeria Signs Defense Pact with Ghana, Kenya</h1>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 27, 2025</p>

    <p>
      In a landmark move to strengthen regional security, Nigeria has signed a new **multilateral defense agreement** with Ghana and Kenya aimed at combating terrorism, cybercrime, and cross-border insurgencies across West and East Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
      The agreement, known as the <strong>“African Security Partnership Pact (ASPP)”</strong>, was finalized during a summit in Accra, Ghana. The pact covers intelligence sharing, joint military training, coordinated counter-terrorism efforts, and rapid response protocols for emerging threats.
    </p>

    <h2>🤝 What the Pact Includes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Joint military drills every 6 months</li>
      <li>Creation of a regional cyber-defense task force</li>
      <li>Emergency troop deployment system</li>
      <li>Collaborative border monitoring operations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Nigeria’s Defense Minister, <strong>Mohammed Badaru Abubakar</strong>, stated that the deal “marks a new chapter in African-led security strategies” and will reduce reliance on foreign intervention.
    </p>

    <h2>🌍 Regional Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Security analysts believe the agreement could improve stability in key regions like the Lake Chad Basin and the Sahel, which have suffered from years of militant attacks and humanitarian crises.
    </p>

    <p>
      ECOWAS has welcomed the pact and hinted at expanding it to include more West African nations later in the year.
