    <h1>📝 The Empty Seat – A Story of Friendship and Farewell</h1>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 28, 2025</p>

    <p>
      In Room 6B of Bright Future Secondary School, there was always noise — laughter, whispers, chalk squeaks. But in one corner, near the window, there was now an <strong>empty seat</strong>. It used to belong to <strong>Kelechi</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kelechi and I had shared that desk since JSS1. We had our own silly language, drew cartoons during boring classes, and swore we’d become “tech bros” and open a studio after university.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was the heart of the class — the peacemaker, the joker, the one who always said, “Guy, no worry, we go blow.” Until he suddenly stopped coming to school in SS2.
    </p>

    <h2>🕊 The News We Didn’t Expect</h2>
    <p>
      Two weeks later, we heard: <strong>Kelechi had passed away</strong> from a sickle cell crisis. Just like that. The entire class fell silent for days. Even the teachers couldn’t bring themselves to erase his name from the attendance list.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Speech Day, I went up to give a speech. My hands shook. I looked at the chair beside me, and though it was empty — it felt full of memories.
    </p>

    <h2>💔 Remembering Him</h2>
    <p>
      Now in university, I still keep our comic book sketches. I’m studying computer science like we planned. I’m building an app in his memory — a platform to support students living with sickle cell disorder.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because Kelechi’s seat may be empty, but what he left behind is still teaching us — to live, laugh, and <strong>not take friendship for granted</strong>.
