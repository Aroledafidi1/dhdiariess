    <h1>üìö FG Approves New National Curriculum for Secondary Schools</h1>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 10, 2025</p>

    <p>
      The Federal Government of Nigeria has officially approved a <strong>new national curriculum for secondary schools</strong>, introducing key subjects like <strong>digital literacy, entrepreneurship, and financial education</strong> as core requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The announcement was made by the Minister of Education, <strong>Prof. Tahir Mamman</strong>, during a press briefing in Abuja. The curriculum will take effect from the 2025/2026 academic session and is part of efforts to reform the education system and better prepare Nigerian students for the 21st-century workforce.
    </p>

    <h2>üß† Key New Subjects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Digital Skills & Coding (JSS1‚ÄìSS3)</li>
      <li>Financial Literacy (Savings, Budgeting, Investment)</li>
      <li>Entrepreneurship & Innovation</li>
      <li>Civic Technology & Responsible Social Media Use</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      According to the Ministry, teachers will receive new training modules starting July, and schools will be equipped with digital learning resources, especially in underserved communities.
    </p>

    <h2>üéì What This Means for Students</h2>
    <p>
      The government believes the new curriculum will <strong>bridge the skills gap</strong>, reduce youth unemployment, and boost innovation across sectors. Students will also engage in hands-on community projects and be encouraged to start early ventures before graduation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stakeholders across the country, including the Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) and the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), have endorsed the changes.
