    <h1>📻 Mama’s Radio – A Story of Dreams and Sacrifice from Ibadan</h1>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 28, 2025</p>

    <p>
      In a small brown bungalow at the edge of <strong>Apete, Ibadan</strong>, lived Mama Tola — a retired tailor known in the neighborhood not for her scissors, but for her **crackling old radio** that never stopped playing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every morning, her radio blasted motivational talks and morning devotion. But one day, her granddaughter, <strong>Tola</strong>, leaned in and said, “Mama, I want to be the one talking inside that radio someday.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Mama smiled, nodded, and quietly started saving money from her weekly garri sales at Bodija market.
    </p>

    <h2>🎓 The Dream Gets Closer</h2>
    <p>
      Years passed. Tola excelled in school and later earned admission into the University of Ibadan to study Mass Communication. She almost dropped out in 300 level when the school fees increased, but Mama sold her last sewing machine and used the money to pay.
    </p>

    <p>
      “One voice can change a life,” Mama always said. “Maybe yours will change the world.”
    </p>

    <h2>🎙️ Full Circle</h2>
    <p>
      Today, Tola is a radio host at a top Lagos station. Every Saturday morning, she dedicates 10 minutes to telling stories of sacrifice and strength — and always ends her show with:  
      <em>"This one is for Mama, who taught me that dreams live in small houses too."</em>
